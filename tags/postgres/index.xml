      <description>This is the first in a small series that will go through the process of compiling an open source spatial stack to store, serve and visualise spatial data. Given we will be working with a number of containers it is beneficial to work with docker-compose.
Note: While it is possible to use Postgres in a docker container, this is not recommended for production purposes. A managed service such as AWS RDS is a better option in these instances.</description>

      <description>Dealing with large and complex geometries in postgis can be computationally expensive, even with a spatial index. To understand why this is we need to have some understanding of how a spatial index works. In simple terms, a spatial index is a bounding box that encapsulates the extent of a geometry, using a spatial index can rapidly speed up spatial processing by first checking which bounding boxes intersect - a comparatively quick process - as opposed to which raw geometries intersect - potentially a lot slower - and more so as the size of your dataset increases.</description>
